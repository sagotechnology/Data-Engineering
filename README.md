# Data Engineering

## Project 1: Query Project
In the Query Project, you will get practice with SQL while learning about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. You'll answer business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. To give you experience with different ways to use those datasets, you will use the web UI (BiqQuery) and the command-line tools, and work with them in Jupyter Notebooks.
