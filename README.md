# Data Engineering

## Project 1: Query Project
In the Query Project, I will practice using SQL while learning about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. I'll answer business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. I will use the web UI (BiqQuery) and the command-line tools, while working with them in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project 2: Tracking User Activity
I work at an ed tech firm. I've created a service that delivers assessments, and now several different customers (e.g., Pearson) want to publish their assessments on it. In this project I prepare the assessment data for data scientists who work for these customers to run queries.
