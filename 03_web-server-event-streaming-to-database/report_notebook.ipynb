    "This notebook is a step-by-step guide for setting up a data pipeline that streams events from a web server into a database.  The major parts of the data pipeline include Flask, Kafka, Spark, HDFS, Hive, and Presto.  For this project's scope, a fictitious game uses the Flask API webserver to write user-generated data into Kafka.  Kafka's topic \"events\" ingests the user-events.  Using Spark, a data sync is set up to stream data into HDFS every ten seconds.  The Hive metastore is used to create a table structure for the join guild and purchase sword events that are then populated with data from HDFS using Presto.  The last section of the report discusses business insights derived from the user data--available via Presto queries. "
