    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. Incentivize users to rider during November and December.  Through my analysis, it became apparent that the worst months of the year were November and December.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increase ridership during the weekends.  The best year for weekend trips was 2014.  Despite the total duration of weekday tips increasing in 2015, when compared to 2014, it ended up finishing with fewer total hours of trips.  The nosedive in weekend trips significantly contributed to 2015 logging fewer hours than 2014.  If the total weekend hours per day were more in line with the total weekday hours per day, a substantial increase in ridership could be realized. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add more bikes and docks to the top ten most popular stations.  The top ten most popular stations (in terms of total trip duration) have a 15% occurrence rate of zero to two bikes or zero to two docking stations available during the hours of 5 AM to 8 PM (the busiest time of the day).  Also, the top three bike stations supply is low upwards of 20% during this time frame.\n",

While 2015 experienced a dip of 2% logging 76,309.37 trip hours.  From 2014 to 2015, subscription hours increased by 12.2%; however, non-subscription hours decreased by 18.3%.  Assuming non-subscription riders rode more during the weekend, then the significant decrease in 2015 weekend rides would be explained."

    "Below is the bq I used to create the percentage of time that a particular bike station has low bikes available or low dock space available.  In order to calculate the \"station low\" percentage, I counted the total number of occurrences when bike availability was low (0,1, or 2 bikes available) and add that to the total of occurrences when dock availability was low.  I then divide that number by the total number of polls made on the bike station and multiply by 100 to derive the percentage of time that bikes/docks are low at a particular station.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I define low as 0, 1, or 2.  Interestingly, I am using both the bike availability low and dock availability low to calculate this metric.  Here is why: If there are zero bikes available, no trips will be started.  Also, if 1 or 2 bikes are available, there is a possibility that the bikes remaining in the dock may be damaged. Therefore a customer will not check the bike out.  On the other hand, low docking stations may deter customers from starting a trip.  They may feel that if there are low amounts of docking stations at the current station, then there may not be any available docking stations at the next station.\n",

    "I considered only the hours of 5 AM to 8 PM for this view.  The reason for doing so is because 96% of all trips are within that timeframe. Earlier in the analysis, I calculated this figure.  This will give better insight into the station bike/dock availability during the times that matter.  If hours outside of this time frame were considered, the average percent during peak hours would not be represented.  My intent was to capture the customers' perception of bike stations--which accomplished by analyzing the busiest hours of the day 5 AM - 8 PM."

    "This is my favorite analysis, partly because I learned how to join three tables and two views, and partly because the insights are fantastic.  From the table, it is evident that the top ten starting stations account for 46% of all 2016 trip duration.  When averaging low bike/rack availability across the top ten stations, it becomes apparent that these stations are low on bikes or racks 15% of the time.  As we look at the top three bike stations, which account for 21% of the business, that number jumps to 23.6%.  From the outside looking in, one way to generate more rides would be to decrease the low bike and rack availability by at least 10% initially. "

    "It is somewhat reassuring to see that three of the most popular trips start station at the beginning of the day become the end stations at the end of the day.  Another observation is the top commuter trip (in the morning) becomes the top trip start station and end station reversed in the evening. Harry Bridges Plaza to 2nd at Townsend is the most popular trip in the morning while 2nd at Townsend to Harry Bridges Plaza is the most popular trip in the evening."
